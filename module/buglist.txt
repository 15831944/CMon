1) lower urgency brand + pending: A brand occurs and the system
   decides not to run it due to lesser urgency.  In the end, that
   thread ends up endlessly ignored unless another interrupt happens.
   It appears what's happening is that the event for the thread to
   become active is not being delivered or interpretted at the right
   time, thus the scheduler is unaware the upcall is active.  The
   current work-around is to send a BRAND_PENDING event whenever we
   add a pending brand.  The scheduler will get this event and will
   schedule the thread.  When there are many interrupts, this kind of
   works.

2) brand_higher_urgency, I believe, makes the assumption somewhere
   that an event actually exists for the interrupted thread.  In any
   case, when the interrupted thread only creates the thread, but does
   not setup events for it, we get a page fault in
   brand_higher_urgency+0x2c8 (8c c7 <c7> 05 00).
