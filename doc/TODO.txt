1) in page fault handler check if current_thread->regs.eip \in
   current_thread->stack_base[current_thread->stack_ptr].spd, then
   current_thread->stack_base[current_thread->stack_ptr].current_composite_spd
   =
   current_thread->stack_base[current_thread->stack_ptr].spd->composite_spd.
   Also do this on a component invocation.

2) in page fault handler, check if the current spd is in a stale
   composite spd, and eax in capability range for current spd (if the
   spd that owns that capability is in the (stale) composite_spd) AND
   if that capability in the current configuration is set to ST.  If
   all of these are true, add the mapping for the destination spd into
   the spd's stale composite spd.  Might want to perform the check
   here as in (1) too, which would solve these problems given that
   check is true.
