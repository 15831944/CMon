Component Creation in Composite
-------------------------------

Component implementations are in the src/component/implementation/
directory.  There is a subdirectory for each interface in which that
is a subdirectory for each component implementation.  When you wish to
create a component for a specific interface the interface directory
should exist, and you should make a subdirectory named specific to
your component.

First, I'll assume you wish to implement a component that has an
interface directory.  We'll look at the lock interface, and the
two_phase lock component (in
src/components/implementation/lock/two_phase/).  The implementation of
the component can be in assembly and C files that reside in this
directory.  In the two_phase lock case, there is only lock.c.  The
Makefile for two_phase is:

C_OBJS=lock.o
ASM_OBJS=
COMPONENT=l.o
INTERFACES=lock
DEPENDENCIES=sched mem_mgr printc timed_blk
IF_LIB=

include ../../Makefile.subsubdir

All C files are listed in C_OBJS, and all assembly objects are listed
in ASM_OBJS.  The final name of the component's object is l.o in
COMPONENT.  A specific component might implement multiple interfaces.
Certainly, it must implement the interface for the directory it is in
(in this case, lock), but it might implement other interfaces as
well.  All implemented interfaces must be listed in INTERFACES.
Importantly, the build system must know which component interfaces
this component is dependent on.  These are listed in DEPENDENCIES.
This two_phase lock component uses the scheduler, memory allocation,
terminal printing, and timed blocking interfaces.  We'll see in the
next example where the IF_LIB variable is used.

Looking at the fixed priority round robin (fprr) component that
implements the sched interface (i.e. it is in
src/components/implementation/sched/fprr), we see that the Makefile
includes IF_LIB=../complib.o.  This states that to create the final
component, it must be linked with the object specified in IF_LIB.  If
all components for a given interface type use shared code, that code
can be placed in the interface directory
(e.g. src/components/implementation/sched/), and in this way it is
linked with all of the components of that interface.

The shared code for a given component interface is found in the
interface directory, e.g. src/components/implementation/sched/.  All C
and assembly (.S) in that directory are compiled into an object:
complib.o.  All component implementations in subdirectories can
include this library as stated in the previous paragraph.  The make
file in src/components/implementation/sched/ is:

INTERFACES=sched
DEPENDENCIES=printc mem_mgr stack_trace sched_conf

include ../Makefile.subdir

If you need to create an interface this is the general format of the
Makefile.  Importantly INTERFACES is set to the name of the
interface.  If there is shared code for all components implementing
this interface, DEPENDENCIES must include a list of the interfaces
this shared code depends on.  Components that do not require shared
code, should leave DEPENDENCIES empty.
